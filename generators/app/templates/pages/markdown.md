Pages can be written in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) using the GitHub Flavored Markdown style. Use the `template` [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) option to determine what template gets used, if you want one.

Pages can also be written in [HTML via Nunjucks](/)
